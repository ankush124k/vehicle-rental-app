Vehicle Rental Application
A full-stack web application that provides a seamless, multi-step form for users to book a rental vehicle. The application features a dynamic UI that fetches data from a backend API, ensuring that vehicle options are always up-to-date. The backend includes business logic to prevent booking conflicts.

Features
Multi-Step Form: A clean, user-friendly interface that guides the user through the booking process one question at a time.

Dynamic & Conditional Steps: Vehicle type and model options are dynamically fetched from the backend based on the user's previous selections (e.g., number of wheels).

Booking Conflict Validation: The backend API ensures that a vehicle cannot be booked for date ranges that overlap with existing bookings.

Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Centralized State Management: Uses Redux Toolkit on the frontend for predictable and robust state management throughout the booking process.

Professional Backend Architecture: The backend is built using a service-based architecture (Routes ‚Üí Controllers ‚Üí Services) for clean separation of concerns and maintainability.
